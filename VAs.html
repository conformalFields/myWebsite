  CFTs and Vertex algerbras
</h1>

    <p>
      CFT arises in many physical processes such as ???. From the lens of probability theory, 
      correlations of observables decay as power laws. 
      Conformal field theory is an instance of quantum field theory, 
      where observables transform nicely under the conformal group, or angle-preserving transformations which consists of
      translations, rotations, scaling and inversions through spheres.
      In dimensions \(d \geq 2\), conformal group Conf(\(d\)) is finite dimenional. 
      Intuitively, each dimension places a constraint on the conformal group,
       but in dimension \(d=2\), Conf(\(2\)) is infinite dimensional!
      It is spanned by all holomorphic and anti-holomorphic maps from \(\mathbb{C}\) to \(\mathbb{C}\).

      Algebra of observables forms an algebraic structure called vertex operator algebra(VOA).
      Mathematically, it is an algebraic structure \((V,(\cdot_{(n)}\cdot)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}},\partial\cdot,\textbf{1})\), 
      of signature \((2^{\infty},1,0)\),
      enjoying an infinity of the following beautiful axioms for all \(n\geq 0, k \geq 0\)

        Left Wick identity
       \[ \quad	a_{(n)}(b_{(-1)}c)-(a_{(n)}b)_{(-1)}c-b_{(-1)}(a_{(n)}c)
        =\sum_{k=1}^n\binom{n}{k}(a_{(k-1)}b)_{(n-k)}c,\]
    
        Right Wick identity
        \[(a_{(-1)}b)_{(n)}c=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{(-k-1)}(b_{(n+k)}c)+b_{(n-k-1)}(a_{(k)}c),\]
    
        Pre-Lie algebra identity
        \[a_{(-1)}(b_{(-1)}c)-b_{(-1)}(a_{(-1)}c)=(a_{(-1)}b-b_{(-1)}a)_{(-1)}c=\sum_{k\geq 0}(-1)^k (b_{(k)}a)_{(-2-k)}c,\]
    
        Associativity
        \[a_{(-1)}(b_{(-1)}c)-(a_{(-1)}b)_{(-1)}c=\sum_{k\geq 0}(-1)^k a_{(-k-2)}(b_{(k)}c)+b_{(-k-2)}(a_{(k)}c),\]
    
        (Skew)Commutativity
        \[a_{(-1)}b-b_{(-1)}a=\sum_{k\geq 0}(-1)^k \partial^k b_{(k)}a.\]

    In mathematics, VOAs play an important role. Monster, a finite simple group of order 
    \(2^{46} \cdot  3^{20} \cdot  5^9 \cdot  7^6 \cdot  11^2 \cdot  13^3 \cdot  17 \cdot 
     19 \cdot  23 \cdot  29 \cdot 31 \cdot  41 \cdot 47 \cdot  59 \cdot 71\simeq 8\cdot 10^{58}\),
     is most easily constructed as group of automorphisms of a certain VOA build from 3 copies of a Leech lattice \(E^8\).

      More specifically, my research focuses on the study of universal VOAs of a prescribed generating type. 
      These algebras, such as 
      \(\mathcal{W}(c,\lambda),\mathcal{W}_{ev}(c,\lambda),\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}_2}(c,k)\)
      Quotients of these algebras correspond to many interesting \(1\)-parameter algebras called \(\mathcal{W}\)-(super)algebras.
      These quotients are in 1-1 correspondence with an exceptional family of curves. Here are some examples drawn(toDo). 
      It is clear that these curves have a symmetry to them.

    At the level of algebras these symmetries correspond to isomorphism of 1-parameter algebras, known as triality.
